# Operations

Defines what an instantiated repository records under `docs/operations/` to keep the
project healthy day-to-day: observability, SLOs, alerts, and maintenance.

**Update triggers (DOC-030):** new critical path (needs metrics + alert), new alert,
changed SLO, new scheduled maintenance task, post-incident action items.

## Structure

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `docs/operations/observability.md` | Where logs/metrics/traces go; how to query them; correlation IDs |
| `docs/operations/slo.md` | SLIs and SLO targets per critical path; error budget policy |
| `docs/operations/alerts.md` | Alert catalog: condition → severity → runbook link |
| `docs/operations/maintenance.md` | Recurring tasks (rotation, cleanup, upgrades) with schedule and owner |
