# docs/foundation/ — Foundation Documentation

This directory contains descriptive guidance and document templates owned by
`ai-dev-foundation`. In an instantiated repository, project-owned documentation stays at
task-oriented paths directly under `docs/`; it MUST NOT be placed below this directory.
Preserved ancestor READMEs are repository-owned inheritance records and use the separate
`docs/inheritance/readmes/<owner>/<repository>.md` namespace defined by
[ADR-0011](adr/0011-own-the-root-readme-in-the-current-repository.md).

Binding AI rules remain in [`.ai/`](../../.ai/), and task procedures remain in
[`.skills/`](../../.skills/). Files here link to those sources instead of duplicating
their rules.

## Language boundary

Foundation documents in this namespace are English. ADR-0008 preserves exactly two
descriptive, human-facing Japanese exceptions:

- [guides/usage.ja.md](guides/usage.ja.md)
- [guides/ai-instruction-files.ja.md](guides/ai-instruction-files.ja.md)

They do not define normative behavior and never override the English rules or sources
they describe. Adding another localized foundation document requires a superseding ADR.
Project-owned documents remain directly under `docs/` and follow the Japanese authoring
rule in ADR-0005.

## Inventory

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [adr/](adr/) | Preserve and synchronize accepted foundation architecture decisions |
| [glossary.md](glossary.md) | Define reusable foundation terminology without occupying the project glossary path |
| [requirements.md](requirements.md) | Choose the project-owned requirements location and naming |
| [guides/](guides/) | Define project documentation structure, onboarding, and update triggers without occupying project-owned paths |
| [inheritance-fleet.json](inheritance-fleet.json) | Declare active, paused, and retired inheritance relationships for read-only fleet audit and impact classification |
| [templates/](templates/) | Copyable skeletons for project-owned documents |
| [troubleshooting/](troubleshooting/) | Diagnose reusable foundation tooling without occupying project-owned troubleshooting paths |

## Template Sync ownership

Template Sync excludes `docs/**` to protect project-owned documentation and selectively
includes `docs/foundation/**`. `actions-template-sync@v2` passes ignore entries to
`git reset --`; exclusions therefore use Git pathspec `:!` syntax, not `.gitignore` `!`
negation. Existing downstream repositories must append this exception block to the end
of their local `.templatesyncignore`:

```gitignore
docs/**
:!docs/foundation/
:!docs/foundation/**
```

The local `.templatesyncignore` is itself protected from synchronization. Review and
merge this change in each existing downstream repository before manually running the
Template Sync workflow. New repositories created from the updated template already have
the exception. The broad `docs/**` exclusion continues to protect
`docs/inheritance/**`; do not add that repository-owned namespace to the synchronized
exceptions.

**Update trigger:** add or update an entry whenever foundation-owned guidance or a
template moves into, within, or out of this namespace.
