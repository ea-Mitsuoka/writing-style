<!--
  FOUNDATION TEMPLATE. Copy to docs/requirements.md (whole project) or
  docs/requirements/<initiative>.md (one initiative), then replace every {{...}} and
  delete the guidance comments. Procedure and rationale: .skills/requirements.skill.md.
  Style is binding — use DOC-002 for objective, literal prose and DOC-003 for
  reader-centered logical structure. After template instantiation, translate every
  heading and table label in the copied document and fill it in Japanese. Use another
  language only when the repository owner or an external contract explicitly requires
  it. Keep this foundation-owned template file in English (ADR-0005).

# Requirements — {{PROJECT_OR_FEATURE_NAME}}

One sentence: what this document specifies and for whom.

## 1. Terms

<!-- Define each term once here; reference it by name everywhere else (DOC-002). -->

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| {{TERM}} | {{DEFINITION}} |

## 2. Assumptions and constraints

<!-- Defined once. Every requirement and cost figure below relies on these. -->

| ID | Type | Statement | Impact if wrong |
|----|------|-----------|-----------------|
| A-1 | assumption | {{...}} | {{...}} |
| C-1 | constraint | {{...}} | {{...}} |

## 3. Purpose and scope

- **Purpose (one sentence):** {{why this exists}}
- **Success metrics (measurable):**

  | Metric | Target | How measured |
  |--------|--------|--------------|
  | {{...}} | {{...}} | {{...}} |

- **In scope:** {{what this delivers}}
- **Non-scope (explicit exclusions):** {{what this deliberately does not deliver}}
- **Stakeholders:**

  | Role | Interest | Decision authority |
  |------|----------|--------------------|
  | {{...}} | {{...}} | {{...}} |

## 4. Functional requirements

<!-- One row per requirement. "Purpose served" = which §3 purpose or metric it traces to. -->

| ID | Requirement | Purpose served | Priority | Basis |

### 4.1 Use cases / user stories
### 4.2 Business rules
### 4.3 States and transitions
### 4.4 Roles and permissions
### 4.5 Error and exception handling

## 5. Non-functional requirements

<!-- Cover the ISO/IEC 25010 characteristics that apply. Every NFR needs a measurement
     method — a target you cannot verify is not a requirement. Delete unused rows. -->

| ID | Characteristic (ISO/IEC 25010) | Requirement | Target | Measurement method | Priority |
|----|-------------------------------|-------------|--------|--------------------|----------|
| NFR-001 | Performance efficiency | {{...}} | {{p95 < 300 ms}} | {{load test at N rps}} | Must |
| NFR-002 | Reliability (availability, RTO, RPO) | {{...}} | {{...}} | {{...}} | |
| NFR-003 | Security (authN/Z, encryption, audit) | {{...}} | {{...}} | {{...}} | |
| NFR-004 | Maintainability | {{...}} | {{...}} | {{...}} | |
| NFR-005 | Usability / accessibility | {{...}} | {{...}} | {{...}} | |

## 6. Data requirements

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| Data model (overview) | {{entities, key relationships}} |
| Expected volume | {{records, growth rate}} |
| Retention | {{period, deletion policy}} |
| PII classification | {{what PII, sensitivity level}} |
| Backup / recovery | {{cadence; link to the RPO in NFR-002}} |

## 7. External interfaces and dependencies

| System / API | Direction | Contract | SLA | Failure handling |
|--------------|-----------|----------|-----|------------------|
| {{...}} | in / out | {{schema, protocol}} | {{...}} | {{retry, fallback}} |

## 8. Infrastructure and cost estimate

<!-- A number without its assumptions is not usable. State them (they live in §2). -->

- **Architecture (overview):** {{components, hosting model}}
- **Cost assumptions:** region {{...}}; unit prices as of {{date/source}}; assumed
  traffic/volume {{...}}.

| Component | Fixed / month | Usage-based basis | Est. / month at baseline | Increment per {{scale unit}} |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| {{...}} | {{...}} | {{...}} | {{...}} | {{...}} |

## 9. Operational requirements

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Monitoring / alerting | {{link to NFR-006}} |
| Incident response | {{runbook reference}} |
| Deploy / rollback | {{procedure, rollback trigger}} |
| Migration | {{data/schema migration needs}} |

## 10. Acceptance criteria

| ID | Criterion | Verifies (req IDs) | Verification method |
|----|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| AC-1 | {{...}} | FR-001, NFR-001 | {{test / demo}} |

## 11. Risks
