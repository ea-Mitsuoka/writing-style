# Skill: Documentation

## Purpose
Produce documentation that lets an agent (or human) act correctly without asking —
current, unambiguous, in the right place, and no larger than needed.

## Inputs
- The trigger: doc-update matrix obligation (DOC-030), stale doc found (DOC-040), or an
  explicit documentation task.
- The authoritative source: the code/behavior being described. Verify claims against
  the code — never document from memory or assumption (GR-042).

## Process
1. Locate the correct home using the inventory (DOC-010) and foundation guide index.
   Search filenames, headings, links, and affected terms without recursively loading
   document bodies. Apply the broader fallback in `.ai/README.md` when ownership or
   relevance is uncertain.
2. Follow the conditional-routing table in `.ai/documentation.md`. When any trigger
   matches, read `.ai/project-document-maintenance.md` completely before acting. If
   relevance is uncertain, apply the broader fallback and read it completely.
3. Read the selected guide and every existing document that owns an affected fact
   completely. One fact, one place — if the fact exists elsewhere, link to it instead of
   restating (DOC-001). Follow a project doc type's own README when present.
4. Write for a reader with zero conversation context: purpose first, frontmatter set,
   structure and representation chosen by DOC-003, absolute dates, runnable examples
   with fake credentials.
5. For APIs: document contract (inputs, outputs, errors, auth) not implementation;
   keep OpenAPI/schema files as the source, prose as commentary.
6. Verify every command/example by running it; every link by resolving it.
7. Delete or fix anything you found stale along the way (DOC-040) — in the same PR if
   small, else file an issue.
8. `docs:` PR, or fold into the change PR when fulfilling DOC-030.

## Decision criteria
- **Where?** Binding rule → `.ai/` (requires careful review). Decision → ADR.
  Description of the system → `docs/`. Module contract → MODULE.md. Front door → README.
- **How long?** As short as completeness allows. If a section needs >2 screens,
  split by reader task, not by topic.
- **Diagram?** Use Mermaid only when it makes a relationship materially easier to
  understand; state the conclusion in text. Never use binary structural diagrams.
- **Doc contradicts code?** Behavior → trust code; intent → trust doc; then fix the
  wrong one and note it (DOC-040).

## Outputs
- Updated/created docs in the correct location, links resolving, examples verified.
- Removed stale content (or issues filed for larger cleanups).

## Checklist
- [ ] Facts verified against code; commands and links tested
- [ ] One-fact-one-place respected; no near-duplicate content created
- [ ] Frontmatter, logical structure, and representation per DOC-001/DOC-003
- [ ] Doc-update matrix fully satisfied for the triggering change
- [ ] An agent with no context could act on this doc alone
